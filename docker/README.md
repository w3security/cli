# Deprecation Notice

Please note, these Docker images are deprecated and may be removed in the future. They remain available only to provide continuity for legacy Snyk integrations. **Snyk does not recommend their use.**

Instead, please use the [`w3security/w3security`](https://hub.docker.com/r/w3security/w3security) Docker images. These images wrap the Snyk CLI and depending on the Tag come with a relevant tooling for different projects. [See the w3security/images on GitHub for more details and examples](https://github.com/w3security/w3security-images).
